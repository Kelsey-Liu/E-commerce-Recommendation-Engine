# E-commerce-Recommendation-Engine

## Data: 
Ecommerce Data Set: Online Book RFM Data (See Sample data spreadsheet tab with this name)

## Challenge: 
Develop a “Recommendation Engine” AI solution for a Website using an Unsupervised segmentation/clustering approach complete with economic analysis and presentation to management to convince the CMO and Webmaster to implement the solution.

## Description: 
An ecommerce website currently recommends “most popular” items to all users with the hope that users will add items to their shopping cart and increase the size of each purchase. This approach is successful by increasing sales for the website and the current CMO/Webmaster do not believe there is a more intelligent solution that is more relevant to each users based on their prior purchases and relationship with the ecommerce website.
